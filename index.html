      <p class="aboutme">
        I am good at dealing with people and lead the atmosphere well due to my
        high affinity and sociality. Also, I get along well with my team members
        and understand other people's feelings well. I tend to think of groups
        more important than individuals. That's why I have a personality that
        constantly strives to achieve joint goals within the organization.You
        may think I'm slow, but you like to learn, and you always think
        positively and eventually do anything when you see the distant future. I
        have a personality that makes everything work somehow.
